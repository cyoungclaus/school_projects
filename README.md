## AAI_551_W1 Final Project
GUI that uses Spotify API to:
 - Get user data
 - Build files consisting of their public data
 - Support two games user's can play with their own Spotify
 - Give details on individual songs, playlists, artists, etc.

GUI should also:
 - Display proper buttons
 - Switch frames when buttons are clicked
 - Give user option to switch between menus
 - Never close unless user directs program to

NOTE: 
    To display your own Spotify account, you must replace CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and CLIENT_NAME
    with your account credentials. Use the following steps:
    1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/ and make a developer account
    2. Make a project (call it whatever it doesn't matter)
        - This project will serve as the connection between my program and your spotify
        - It will give you graphics of when you requested for things like songs and playlists
    3. Underneath the project name on the project screen it will show your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET
    4. Your CLIENT_NAME is your username

    The reason for this information is because allowing programs to have access to your
    CLIENT_SECRET means they can change things like playlists, artists, songs, etc. that
    you have saved on your account.
    For this reason, I replaced my own Spotify information that I was testing my app with,
    with that of my backup account which is throwing errors because it is a smaller account.
